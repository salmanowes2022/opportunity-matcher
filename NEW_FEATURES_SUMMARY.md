## 🔧 Technical Details

### How Batch Matching Works:

1. **Load Database**
   ```python
   from opportunities_storage import load_all_opportunities
   all_opportunities = load_all_opportunities()  # 11 scholarships
   ```

2. **Create Progress Tracking**
   ```python
   progress_bar = st.progress(0)
   status_text = st.empty()
   ```

3. **Evaluate Each Opportunity**
   ```python
   for idx, opp_data in enumerate(all_opportunities):
       opportunity = Opportunity(...)
       result = evaluate_match(profile, opportunity)
       batch_results.append({'opportunity': ..., 'result': ..., 'score': ...})
       progress_bar.progress((idx + 1) / len(all_opportunities))
   ```

4. **Sort by Score**
   ```python
   batch_results.sort(key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
   ```

5. **Display with Metrics**
   ```python
   high_matches = sum(1 for r in batch_results if r['score'] >= 0.7)
   # Display color-coded expanders with full details
   ```

### Performance:
- **API Calls:** 11 calls to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Time:** ~30-60 seconds (depends on API latency)
- **Cost:** ~$0.11-$0.22 per batch evaluation (at current GPT-4o-mini pricing)
- **Error Handling:** Skips failed evaluations, continues with rest
